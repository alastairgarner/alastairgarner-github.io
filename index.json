The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we\u0026rsquo;ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it\u0026rsquo;s thing. Mission accomplished!\nAnd now for a massively large image \u0026mdash; it has no alignment.\n![no-alignment]({{ \u0026lsquo;/images/image-alignment-1200x4002.jpg\u0026rsquo; | absolute_url }})\nThe image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area.

Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there \u0026mdash; Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don\u0026rsquo;t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone else tell you differently.\nIn just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah \u0026mdash; Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.\nAnd just when you thought we were done, we\u0026rsquo;re going to do them all over again with captions!\n Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.  The figure above happens to be centered. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.\nItty-bitty caption.  The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned with the .align-left class.\nAs you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.

When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\u0026rsquo;s mind.

There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\u0026rsquo;s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other\u0026rsquo;s nose, and so forth.

When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\u0026rsquo;s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter.
