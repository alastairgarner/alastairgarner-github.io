Ultimately, this is the interface you\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at for the majority of your writing and edits, so pick whichever program you are happiest working in.\nPersonally, this is the part where I fell in love with Typora. The interface is clean and super aesthetic, offering little distraction between yourself and putting words on the page. It also renders markdown as you type - as opposed a bare-bones text editor.\nRecommend looking at my example - if you don\u0026rsquo;t like it, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to keep reading!\nLatex Ultimately, $\\LaTeX$ is the system used to format your plain-text manuscript into a beautifully typeset pdf file. It\u0026rsquo;s available for all systems and can be downloaded from here.\nPandoc Pandoc\n Markdown editor (*Optional, but recommended) Latex ($\\LaTeX$, specifically XeTeX)  Pandoc  Pandoc-crossref  Organising your workflow Unlike writing with classical \u0026ldquo;rich-text\u0026rdquo; editors like Word/LibreOffice/OpenOffice, the formatting and styling of your thesis are defined in standalone files. On first thought this might seem frustrating, or even impractical, but it actually offers remarkable flexibility. For instance, if you decide you want to switch all your headings from a serif to a sans serif font, bump them up to 16pt and centre them, this can be done with a one line change, rather than manually editing every header.\nThe following folder structure is the particular one I used in writing my thesis, but is by no means a gold standard. The structure and file names are all up to your own discretion.\nthesis/ ├── figs/ ├── pandoc-crossref ├── references.bib ├── style.csl ├── options.yaml ├── header.tex ├── titlepage.tex (optional) └── thesis.md  I empathise with anyone who looks at this file structure, with five peculiar file types, and is a little off-put. But worry not, I\u0026rsquo;ll explain.\nFiles you need not edit\u0026hellip;\n  figs folder is where you can store any images or figures to be included in the document.\n  pandoc-crossref is simply the executable file need to correctly format references in our document.\n  style.csl is a file that contains the citation style you\u0026rsquo;d like to use in your document. Csl files for most journals can be found on Zotero.org.\n  references.bib is the file that contains all your references. You can generate this file by exporting your references from whichever citation manager you use, be that Mendeley, EndNote, Zotero, etc.\n  Files you should edit\u0026hellip;\n options.yaml allows you to list command line options to pass to pandoc, instructing it on how to generate your typeset thesis. header.tex allows you to add any $\\LaTeX$ packages or commands to modify the formatting of your document . titlepage.tex is an optional file allowing you to define a custom title page, if the default is not to your liking. thesis.md contains the actual content of your thesis.  Writing in markdown If you\u0026rsquo;re already familiar with Markdown, feel free to jump straight to the next section.\nWriting in markdown\n# Chapter ## Subheading ### Subsubheading Some text with a point I'd like to **emphasise**. A *Species name* that just begs for some italics.   which will render like this in your markdown editor\u0026hellip;\nRealistically, for 99% of your thesis-writing, this is all the markdown know-how you really need. Remember, at this point you need not worry about font, size, colour, or any other styling of your actually thesis. This is just about getting words on the page. Markdown makes this clean and aesthetic.\nCitations I\u0026rsquo;ll admit, the Mendeley plugin in MS Word has done me solid service through my undergrad, but referencing in Markdown (more specifically, with LaTeX), is almost as straightforward. The first thing you need to do is export your list of references to a .bib file (BibTeX format) from your reference manager. This is simple enough in Mendeley (File \u0026gt; Export) and I\u0026rsquo;m sure the same can be said for other reference managers.\nThe second thing you need to do is work out which citation style you want to use. In some cases this may be a strict guideline set by you institution, but in my case I just picked the journal whose style I liked best (Current Biology). Having worked this out, head to zotero.org and download the .csl file for your desired citation style.\nAll that\u0026rsquo;s left to do is to start dropping citations in your manuscript. To do this, you need to know the \u0026lsquo;citation key\u0026rsquo; for the paper in question, which is set by your reference manager. In my case, Mendeley lists citation keys as LastNameYYYY.\nThis handle can be used to plonk the citation into your text with this simple syntax,\nPrevious literature has outlined the utility of using 'pandoc' to convert Markdown files to pdf files [@LastName2019], though many still rely on rich-text editors for writing theses.  In your final pdf, this will render both a hyperlinked (clickable) reference, as well as the bibliography entry, both with the specified citation style.\nFigures I have tried to repress the memories of battles lost against MS Word, trying to arrange images, only for them to vanish, hang off pages or decapitate paragraphs. Blissfully, inserting images or figures into markdown is (almost) entirely pain free. Namely, when generating a pdf with pandoc, figure placement is automatic, giving full pages to large figures, or tactfully inserting smalerl figures above of below text - no manual manoeuvring!\nI recommend creating a separate directory for figures, simply to keep your working directory uncluttered. Pandoc and LaTeX can handle all conventional bitmap image formats (png, jpeg), but more importantly they can also handle vector-based images; eps, pdf and svg (enabled by the built-in rsvg-convert package). From here, some Markdown editors (like Typora) will allow you to drag and drop images into whichever line you like. Alternatively, you can type out the following syntax to insert you image:\n![An example figure.](./figs/figure.png){#fig:one}  Your figure caption should be entered within the square brackets, while the path to the image (relative or absolute) is placed between the parentheses. Alternatively, you can link remote image files with a URL from your personal cloud storage, image repo, or anywhere else on the internet, and they will be incorporated into your pdf.\nThe curly brackets are an optional syntax (enabled by the pandoc-crossref extension) allowing you to create a figure handle, with which you can create within-document hyperlinks, allowing you to jump from text to figure. Define the handle with  {#fig:my_handle} and you can deploy the link, like so:\nMaking within-document links to figures is easy, as outlined in [@fig:my_handle].  image\nJust make sure that handles for different figures are unique!\nIt is even possible to do subfigure referencing with pandoc-crossref, though I have not tried it myself. Instead, I settled to reference subfigures as [@fig:my_handle]B, which reads as \u0026ldquo;fig. 1B\u0026rdquo; in the final pdf.\nYaml metadata  Converting to pdf Step up to the microphone, pandoc.\nPandoc is the a wonderful tool that will let you convert plain text documents to just about any format you like. HTML? Walk in the park. Pdf? Yeah, no problem. Presentation slides? Hold my beer\u0026hellip;\nThe gist of our Markdown to pdf conversion is that it takes the basic syntax of Markdown (heading, subheading, bold, italics, etc), translates that into equivalent LaTeX syntax, then uses this to generate the fully fledged pdf.\nBasic usage To start, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to navigate to your project folder in your terminal. You can then enter the following command (on Mac or Ubuntu):\npandoc -o thesis.pdf thesis.md  At it\u0026rsquo;s most\nPandoc has a formidable host of options, allowing you to specify the\nAt it\u0026rsquo;s most basic, default formatting\nAdding command line options\n options.yaml  Adding styling\n header.tex  Making it pretty  custom titlepage custom fonts redefining heading/subheadings adding supplemental figures  forcing bibliography location     Other With Typora and other dynamically rendered Markdown editors this image should appear continuous with your text.\n\u0026hellip;which renders like this.\nBetter still, by downloading the pandoc-crossref package\nStructure   Intro  for the love of simple formatting (not as true as you think)   Why do this?  Dislike for rich-text editors Love of markdown (if yet unfound) automatic toc \u0026amp; reference formatting automatic figure placement beautiful, consistent formatting   Why not do this?  need for WYSIWYG don\u0026rsquo;t want to learn a little latex desire not to debug   So why not just use Latex? Requirements Referencing  Supplementals   Figure referencing Importing figures Making your own title page On using svgs Special characters (degrees, superscript \u0026amp; subscript) A word on R Markdown  Troubleshooting Citations Should you ever find that your citations are not appearing in your pdf, or pandoc is telling you that citations keys are missing, here are two likely causes:\n You\u0026rsquo;ve added a new paper to your library since you last exported a .bib file - you\u0026rsquo;ll need to export this file whenever you update your library. You\u0026rsquo;re using the wrong citation key. Some keys may have a suffix (e.g. Smith2009a) in cases where multiple files exist with the same lastname and date, or where you have duplicate files in your library. You can check either the .bib file or your citation manager to find the correct citation key.  Figures I did hit a couple of snags with figures:\n Long captions on tall figures do not obey the bottom margin, nor the bottom of the page, so can run into page numbers or even off of the page. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there is a fix for this, it just might take some googling. This can be avoided if your figure arrangement is flexible. Editing figure captions in Typora can be a little frustrating (you\u0026rsquo;ll find out why). Just switch to \u0026lsquo;Source Code Mode\u0026rsquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s much easier. If you want to include supplmental figures, you have to employ a little trick to get them to reference properly (see later in this doc). The svg files I tested (generated in MATLAB) sometimes rendered strangely in the final pdf, especially regarding text. I resolved this by installing Inkscape (vector editing software) and downloading the pandoc-svg filter (included in my github repo), which uses Inkscape, rather than rsvg-convert, to convert svg files to pdfs.

They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, \u0026ldquo;Oh, why can\u0026rsquo;t you remain like this for ever!\u0026rdquo; This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.\nMrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children\u0026rsquo;s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.\nThis post has a manual excerpt \u0026lt;!--more--\u0026gt; set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied:\nexcerpt_separator: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;!--more--\u0026gt;\u0026quot;  If you could keep awake (but of course you can\u0026rsquo;t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\u0026rsquo;s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child\u0026rsquo;s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\u0026rsquo;s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other\u0026rsquo;s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\u0026rsquo;s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael\u0026rsquo;s minds, while Wendy\u0026rsquo;s began to be scrawled all over with him.

It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.\nThis post has a manual excerpt \u0026lt;!--more--\u0026gt; set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied:\nexcerpt_separator: \u0026quot;\u0026lt;!--more--\u0026gt;\u0026quot;  If you could keep awake (but of course you can\u0026rsquo;t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\u0026rsquo;s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child\u0026rsquo;s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\u0026rsquo;s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other\u0026rsquo;s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat].
